# Reflection:
Galloway’s argument that video games are fundamentally about action rather than passive consumption is especially relevant to Device 6. While its interface looks like a digital novel or ebook, Device 6 is far from a conventional reading experience. Players do not just absorb text. They navigate it, manipulate it, and interact with it in ways that make reading a core mechanic of play. This aligns with Galloway’s idea that games are enacted and only come to life through the player’s engagement. Unlike a traditional novel, which unfolds linearly, Device 6 demands spatial awareness. Players must swipe, scroll, and rotate their devices to explore different narrative paths. The text itself often bends and twists, turning the act of reading into a puzzle. This reinforces Galloway’s idea that gaming is a cybernetic system where both the operator and the machine work together. The game’s metaleptic design further complicates the boundaries between diegetic and nondiegetic actions. Mechanical inputs like swiping are not just ways to advance the story. They are part of the story. By integrating interaction directly into the narrative structure, Device 6 moves beyond literature. It uses the logic of gameplay to immerse the player in a world where reading and action become inseparable. Another example would be that at the end of each chapter in Device 6, the game presents surveys that feel intrusive and self-referential, blurring the line between narrative and player interaction. These surveys initially appear to be nondiegetic acts, directly addressing the player outside the story. However, as the story unfolds, it could also be considered as diegetic acts, triggered by the in-game organization or Player249 evaluating Anna within the narrative. The player's participation in these surveys mirrors Anna’s own role as a test subject Player248, reinforcing the game’s themes of control and manipulation. One of the things I appreciate about Device 6 is its limitation on nondiegetic operator actions for players like the lack of a traditional menu page or a clear way to pause the game on the interface. Unlike most games, where players can access settings or take a break through a pause menu, Device 6 keeps the player immersed in its unfolding mystery without an obvious escape. Without a pause function, Device 6 reinforces the idea that the player, much like Anna, is trapped within the system and deeply engaged in the narrative, instead of feeling like an external operator fully controlling or managing the game. 

Designing a game in Bitsy requires careful consideration of how the placement and configuration of the tiles, sprites, and items shape both the mechanics and the player's interaction with the game world. One key design decision is whether a tile should function as a wall (blocking movement) or remain passable, which directly influences the game’s level structure and progression. Walls create boundaries, guiding players through specific paths, while non-wall tiles can act as open doors, open spaces, or even illusions of barriers, subtly shaping how players explore. This distinction is crucial when designing mechanics, as it enables features like secret passageways or environmental storytelling through selective accessibility. Beyond static tiles, interactions with items and sprites add depth to the experience. Sprites can be used as NPCs to deliver dialogues, while items allow players to collect objects that trigger events or modify game states. For example, in my Bitsy game design, I created a maze-like environment where the player must find the correct open door among many to progress to the next level. To enhance exploration and provide guidance, I incorporated interactive sprites such as a cat and a flower, which the player can engage with to receive hints about the correct door. These dialogue triggering elements add an extra layer of interaction, encouraging players to explore their surroundings and use the provided clues to navigate the maze effectively. These design choices reinforce Galloway’s emphasis on gaming as an action based medium, where engagement arises not from passive observation but from meaningful interaction with space and objects.
